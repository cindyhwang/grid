      <p><em>Sol LeWitt & the Grid</em> is set in two typefaces. The first typeface is Gridnik, a geometrical typeface designed by Wim Crouwel in 1974; all of the characters are based on a square grid and feature a combination of only 45- and 90-degree angles at the joints. The second typeface is AG Book, a variant of Berthold Akzidenz-Grotesk designed by GÃ¼nter Gerhard Lange between 1969 and 1973.</p>

      <p>This website was designed by Cindy Hwang for HUMS 304, or The Grid: Knowledge, Practice, Representation, a course offered at Yale University in Spring 2015 and instructed by Anna Bokov, Stephen Krewson, and Adri&aacute;n Lerner.</p>
