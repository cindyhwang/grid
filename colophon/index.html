    <h1>Colophon</h1>

    <div class="container">

      <p><em>Sol LeWitt & the Grid</em> is set in two typefaces. The first is Gridnik, a geometrical typeface designed by Wim Crouwel in 1974; all of the characters are based on a square grid and feature a combination of only 45- and 90-degree angles at the joints. The second is AG Book, a variant of the grotesque sans-serif typeface Akzidenz-Grotesk designed by GÃ¼nter Gerhard Lange between 1969 and 1973.</p>

      <p>This website was designed by Cindy Hwang for HUMS 304, or &#8223;The Grid: Knowledge, Practice, Representation,&#8221; a course instructed by Anna Bokov, Stephen Krewson, and Adri&aacute;n Lerner at Yale University in Spring 2015.</p>
